<p>England is in shambles following the landmark coup d’etat staged by William the Conqueror and it's up to the court of nobles to rebuild. Following the Battle of Hastings and the siege of London, William is the first Norman king of England and the nobles must contend with what that means for their future. Small rebellions of peasants and nobles alike stir up trouble and threaten to topple William from his precarious position. It is up to the delegates to decide if they will join the rebellious forces trying to overthrow the new Norman king or attempt to solidify his rule as the new king of England. Who will rise and who will fall in William the Conqueror’s Court?</p>
