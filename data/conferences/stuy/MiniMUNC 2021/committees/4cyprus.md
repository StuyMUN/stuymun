The antagonism between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus has come to a head as Turkish forces have just invaded northern Cyprus, occupying 37% of the country that’s still filled with Greeks. A ceasefire has been established, despite the past bloodshed and destruction, but the chaos isn’t over yet. Delegates have to deal with the short-term problems of resolving the refugee crisis, preventing ethnic cleansing, and rebuilding the parts of Cyprus that have been destroyed. Ultimately, they have to determine Cyprus’ future and reach a solution that will satisfy both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Who will remain victorious?
