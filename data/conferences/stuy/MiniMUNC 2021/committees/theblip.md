Half the world has disappeared after Thanos snapped his fingers in what would later be labelled as “The Blip.” Among those who were lost to this catastrophic event were several of the world’s heroes including the Scarlet Witch, the Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, and the Black Panther. Those who remained were left to care for a world which was suffering massive consequences, along with the arrival of the mysterious Silver Surfer. The Avengers have split up, devastated by their loss to Thanos, and there is no one left to defend against the incoming threat. With the world in shambles, you must come together, formulate a plan and put together a new team to battle the world’s new villain. Will you, as heroes, be able to put your own goals aside and help save the world? (The information that will be used in the committee will mostly use all MCU content released up to but not including Avengers: Endgame, along with some information from the comics which will be detailed in the background guide).
