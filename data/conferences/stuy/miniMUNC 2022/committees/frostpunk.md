In the Summer of 1886, strange weather patterns started to appear across the world. Killer snow storms in northern areas, frost in tropical areas—the situation continued to worsen until these weather conditions caused the “Great Frost.”, a volcanic winter. This phenomena soon made the world inhospitable without the aid of Heat Generator Towers. Civilization collapsed, but with the help of Britain’s Heat Generator Towers built in the northern reaches of the globe and cities fueled by the great minds like Nikola Tesla, it was shown that the preservation of life in these harsh conditions is possible. The newest (and perhaps one of the last) settlements in this barren world is New London, which faces potentially catastrophic threats from the harsh weather and wilderness, a lack of stable government, and increasingly scarce resources. It is up to you, o great scientists, explorers, and politicians of today, to create and develop your new home in the settlement of New London while facing these threats. Are you ready to brave the storm and ensure New London's future?
