The year is 323 BC, and Alexander the Great is dead! Following the great warrior’s sudden death, his expansive empire is left incredibly unstable, with no clear future. Emperor Alexander left no direct heirs or able male relatives to take the throne, so the government is thrown into chaos.  The local aristocracy begins battling and negotiating for control over the wealthiest and largest fragments of this great empire. Meanwhile, they struggle to protect the unstable nation they hope to control from peasant uprisings and invasions from other civilizations who seek to take advantage of the chaos. The power to divide this massive and very wealthy empire is now in your hands. As a delegate, it’s up to you to decide how to maintain, or destroy, the grand and expansive empire Alexander built. Will you seize your opportunity to build a successful civilization or will you fall victim to your fellow nobles' attempts to destroy it? The choice is yours.
