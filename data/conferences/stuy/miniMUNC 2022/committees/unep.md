The Industrial Revolution brought new methods of energy production and helped the human population to skyrocket. However, with the growing effect of climate change, and the continued problem of world hunger, sustainability and reduction of waste is more important than ever. Delegates will be thrown into what is possibly the biggest crisis that humanity faces: accelerated by the dual catastrophes of the COVID pandemic and war in Ukraine, delegates will have to identify, then propose solutions to sources of waste throughout the world. Delegates will also have to consider the perspectives of a diverse variety of countries, each with their own interests.
