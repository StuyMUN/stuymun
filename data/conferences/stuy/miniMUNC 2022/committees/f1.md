As the eyes of the motorsport world set on Austin, Texas for the 2022 United States Grand Prix, the 20 Formula 1 drivers gather not on the grid, but in a conference room. As the sportâ€™s voices, they have taken it upon themselves to discuss the future of F1. Classic race tracks with iconic histories are being replaced with new street circuits in wealthy countries. The climate crisis has brought questions about the sustainability of gas-powered racing. Conversations about race and money have been brought to the forefront by the lack of diversity and large costs & spending across the league. The drivers each have an agenda and issues most important to them, but they must reach a consensus before qualifying begins.
