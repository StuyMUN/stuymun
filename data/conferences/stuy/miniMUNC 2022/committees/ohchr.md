While the death penalty is still employed in some countries today, there are others that have classified it as unnecessarily cruel and ineffective due to the lack of evidence toward its deterrent effect on crime and inconsistency with Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that everyone has the right to life. The goal of capital punishment is to execute criminals convicted of intentional killing to prevent them from murdering again, thereby maintaining the safety of citizens. However, the death penalty is not only used against murderers; others have been executed for crimes such as drug crimes. Having the death penalty always runs the risk of executing innocent people, especially in cases in which people are convicted largely due to their race or ethnicity, rather than substantial evidence. In OHCHR: Validity of the Death Penalty, delegates will discuss the merits of the death penalty and debate its use.
