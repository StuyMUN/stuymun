The Stuyvesant Model UN Team is proud to announce that preparations for StuyMUNC 2022 are well under way! 

StuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesantâ€™s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area. StuyMUNC has grown tremendously over the last two decades; last year alone, we hosted over 200 participants in eleven committees, topics of which ranged from Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic to being a pirate during the Golden Age of Piracy. 

We are proud to invite you to our 18th annual conference and hope that you will join us this May as we begin yet another exciting conference.
