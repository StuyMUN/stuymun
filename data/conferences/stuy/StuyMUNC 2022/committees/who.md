In this committee, we will be focusing on the controversy surrounding genome editing, a form of genetic engineering in which DNA is altered, removed, replaced, or added inside the genome of a living organism. There is a strong opposition to this with critics arguing that CRISPR and related methods are not fully safe to use, and the idea of creating a more “desirable” gene pool through artificially altering the human genome can give rise to eugenics. In addition, many countries already have laws and restrictions in place that limit gene editing, while some have gone so far as to completely ban the practice. With this topic generating much controversy, delegates will discuss the pros and cons of gene editing for the unborn and the potential implications this can have on society, and whether this is a goal worth pursuing and if so, how it can be implemented.
