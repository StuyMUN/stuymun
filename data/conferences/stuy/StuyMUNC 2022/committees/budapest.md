After the Soviet Unionâ€™s collapse, its nuclear weapons have been distributed among its successor states. Now, delegates from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, as well as from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom will have to navigate a world without the Soviet Union. Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan will have leverage to secure their own futures, resolve territorial disputes, and create productive partnerships with one another and Russia. By the same token, any miscalculations by any side can have devastating consequences.
