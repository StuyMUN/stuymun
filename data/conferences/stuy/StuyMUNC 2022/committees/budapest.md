For almost fifty years, the Soviet Union and the United States have been engaged in a nuclear standoff since the development of atomic weapons by both countries in the 1940s. After the Soviet Unionâ€™s collapse, its nuclear weapons have been distributed among its successor states. Now, the former Soviet republics of Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan have various amounts of nuclear weapons. Delegates from these countries, as well as from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom will have to navigate a world without the Soviet Union. Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan will have leverage to secure their own futures, resolve territorial disputes, and create productive partnerships with one another and Russia. By the same token, any miscalculations by any side can have devastating consequences.
