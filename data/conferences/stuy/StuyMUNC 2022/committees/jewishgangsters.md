It’s the 1920s, and Prohibition is in full swing. New York City, the biggest port on the entire East Coast, is home to nearly all sorts of activities you can think of. Scheming, drug trafficking, and gambling are just a few of the many ways to make money real quick real fast. Organized crime is on the rise, and it’s made up of all sorts of ethnic groups. Italian, Irish, but most importantly, Jewish gangs are on the rise. In this committee, delegates will represent different Jewish gangsters of the era as they vie for control of the Big Apple and cause conflict, concern, and confusion along the way.
