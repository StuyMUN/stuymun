In 1828, a tariff was introduced by President John Quincy Adams to protect the manufacturing of American goods and weaken the colonial relationship that America had with Europe. However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.
Northern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.
With President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on statesâ€™ rights? How will senators adjust to the crisis at hand before it escalates to a Civil War?
