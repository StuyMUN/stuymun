SciMUNC XV is the Model UN Conference hosted by our dear friends over at Bronx Science. The conference will be held virtually on Saturday, December 11, 2021. Position papers are mandatory, being due by Friday, December 3, 2021. You will need to pay the delegate fee of $10, which we will follow up on if you are selected. We have the privilege of having many great spots this SciMUNC so we expect every delegate attending to train diligently and be very committed in the weeks coming. 

NOTICE: Cutting this conference without reasonable notice and valid excuse will result in significantly less spot opportunities for you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact any of us on the Upper Secretariat.
