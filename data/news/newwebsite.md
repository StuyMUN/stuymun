title: New Website Finally Released!
---
Hey besties,  

Our team finally has its own dedicated website (props to [Myles Pasetsky](https://github.com/selym3) and [Paul Serbanescu](https://github.com/pserb)!

Here you'll be able to find upcoming conferences, new delegate resources, and info relating to our team. All info relating to miniMUNC/StuyMUNC will also be here!

If you have any concerns, please reach out to Andrey Sokolov on Messenger.
