title: New Website!

---
Hey StuyMUN,

After a really long while, we're finally proud to release our new website! Huge props to [Myles Pasetsky](https://github.com/selym3) and [Paul Serbanescu](https://github.com/pserb) for coding both the backend and the frontend of the website, respectively. Expect most of our team's updates to be posted both here and on [StuyActivities](https://stuyactivities.org/mun)!

If you have any suggestions for how we can improve the website, be sure to message [Andrey Sokolov](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100037622327482) either on Messenger or Discord(Honky_Cow#0884).

Hope you're having a great night!
-StuyMUN Webmaster Team
