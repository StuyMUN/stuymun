The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that about 14% of jobs today are vulnerable to automation. Job decline has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with unemployment rates increasing and employers making an effort to avoid human contact. However, automation can also be seen in a positive light, as it boosts productivity and allows new professions to be created. Delegates will have the opportunity to decide whether automation is beneficial or not, how to make automation equitable for workers and help them adapt to a changing work environment, and how market and consumer demands can be met at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"ECOSOC: Right of Work","chair":"Neve Diaz Carr","codirector":"Aaron Hui","bglink":""},"2sochum":{"content":"\u003cp\u003eWhat is the cost of morality? Should governments be able to suppress citizens to maintain ethnic tranquility? In the SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict committee, delegates will discuss the ability of governments to defy human rights for the prevention of wars and genocide. Rising ethnic tensions and conflict in places such as Africa and Spain have led to the discussion of if human rights should be protected at all costs. Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid? International law, alliances, and tension all come into play as delegates take up the role of a nation with a specific viewpoint on morality in the face of government action.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict","chair":"Naya Mukul","codirector":"Cameron Kluger","bglink":""},"3nyc2050":{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe city’s richest residents have moved to the Midwest. From SoHo to Midtown, storefronts are closed and covered. Any store still open has a “Store Closing” sign in its doorway, hoping to attract the rare customer who might pass by. The city that once had a population of nearly 8.5 million now has a population of 5 million, as many residents fled to places that offered more stability. It has been nearly 30 years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city has yet to recover from the financial issues of the time. Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble. Add in the refusal of politicians to work collaboratively across party lines, and you have a complete fiscal fiasco. Enough is enough, and the government has called for a meeting between both city and state leaders to save NYC before it collapses for good.
