Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.\nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.\nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side.

There is a strong opposition to this with critics arguing that CRISPR and related methods are not fully safe to use, and the idea of creating a more “desirable” gene pool through artificially altering the human genome can give rise to eugenics. In addition, many countries already have laws and restrictions in place that limit gene editing, while some have gone so far as to completely ban the practice. With this topic generating much controversy, delegates will discuss the pros and cons of gene editing for the unborn and the potential implications this can have on society, and whether this is a goal worth pursuing and if so, how it can be implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"WHO: Genome Sequencing","chair":"Maya Nelson","codirector":"Simone Raleigh","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/2021/stuy/who.pdf","ordering":1}},"details":{"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Stuyvesant Model UN Team is proud to announce that preparations for StuyMUNC 2022 are well under way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesant’s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area.

The goal of capital punishment is to execute criminals convicted of intentional killing to prevent them from murdering again, thereby maintaining the safety of citizens. However, the death penalty is not only used against murderers; others have been executed for crimes such as drug crimes.
