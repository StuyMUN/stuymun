However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region. \nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Senator John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation. \nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights? How will senators adjust to the crisis at hand before it escalates to a Civil War?</p>\n","title":"Historical Committee: US Senate 1832 Nullification Crisis","chair":"Aaron Hui","codirector":"Andrew Park","bglink":""},"nycmayoralcabinet":{"content":"","title":"NYC Mayoral Cabinet: Tackling Gentrification and Homelessness","chair":"Naya Mukul and Olivia Tedesco","codirector":null,"bglink":""},"starchamber":{"content":"<p>Contrary to its name, the United Kingdom is falling apart! The gaping divide between the various culturally and linguistically distinct nations of the union has widened in recent years, especially following the political and economic turmoil caused by Brexit.  However, the pandemic appears to have pushed these conflicts to their breaking point, culminating in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland formally calling for secession. This committee deals with these complex issues of unification, calling on an assortment of representatives from across the British Isles to discuss what it means to be part of a union. To make things even more interesting, delegates are discussing these issues in the form of the secretive medieval court known as the “Star Chamber”, allowing for unlikely alliances and solutions. The delegates have the power to decide, once and for all: will this Union stand or be no more—and will it be by peace or by war?</p>\n","title":"Star Chamber: Secession of the Union (2022)","chair":"Justin Murdock","codirector":"Madhavi Tiruchelvam and Luca Adeishvili","bglink":""},"unoosa":{"content":"","title":"UNOOSA: Lunar Mining","chair":"Tanim Miah","codirector":"Elaine Huang and Lesley Lo","bglink":""},"who":{"content":"","title":"WHO: Genome Sequencing","chair":"Maya Nelson","codirector":"Simone Raleigh","bglink":""}},"details":{"content":"<p>The Stuyvesant Model UN Team is proud to announce that preparations for StuyMUNC 2022 are well under way! </p>\n<p>StuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesant’s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that about 14% of jobs today are vulnerable to automation. Job decline has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with unemployment rates increasing and employers making an effort to avoid human contact. However, automation can also be seen in a positive light, as it boosts productivity and allows new professions to be created. Delegates will have the opportunity to decide whether automation is beneficial or not, how to make automation equitable for workers and help them adapt to a changing work environment, and how market and consumer demands can be met at the same time.</p>\n","title":"ECOSOC: Right of Work","chair":"Neve Diaz Carr","codirector":"Aaron Hui","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/ecosoc.pdf","ordering":1},"england":{"content":"<p>England is in shambles following the landmark coup d’etat staged by William the Conqueror and it&#39;s up to the court of nobles to rebuild.

Small rebellions of peasants and nobles alike stir up trouble and threaten to topple William from his precarious position.

Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble.

Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid?
