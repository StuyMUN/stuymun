New York City, the biggest port on the entire East Coast, is home to nearly all sorts of activities you can think of. Scheming, drug trafficking, and gambling are just a few of the many ways to make money real quick real fast. Organized crime is on the rise, and it’s made up of all sorts of ethnic groups. Italian, Irish, but most importantly, Jewish gangs are on the rise. In this committee, delegates will represent different Jewish gangsters of the era as they vie for control of the Big Apple and cause conflict, concern, and confusion along the way.</p>\n","title":"Jewish Gangsters","chair":"River Yuditsky","codirector":"Lina Khamze and Andrey Sokolov","bglink":""},"nullification":{"content":"<p>In 1828, a tariff was introduced by President John Quincy Adams to protect the manufacturing of American goods and weaken the colonial relationship that America had with Europe. However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region. \nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Senator John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation. \nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights? How will senators adjust to the crisis at hand before it escalates to a Civil War?</p>\n","title":"Historical Committee: US Senate 1832 Nullification Crisis","chair":"Aaron Hui","codirector":"Andrew Park","bglink":""},"nycmayoralcabinet":{"content":"","title":"NYC Mayoral Cabinet: Tackling Gentrification and Homelessness","chair":"Naya Mukul and Olivia Tedesco","codirector":null,"bglink":""},"starchamber":{"content":"<p>Contrary to its name, the United Kingdom is falling apart! The gaping divide between the various culturally and linguistically distinct nations of the union has widened in recent years, especially following the political and economic turmoil caused by Brexit.  However, the pandemic appears to have pushed these conflicts to their breaking point, culminating in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland formally calling for secession. This committee deals with these complex issues of unification, calling on an assortment of representatives from across the British Isles to discuss what it means to be part of a union. To make things even more interesting, delegates are discussing these issues in the form of the secretive medieval court known as the “Star Chamber”, allowing for unlikely alliances and solutions. The delegates have the power to decide, once and for all: will this Union stand or be no more—and will it be by peace or by war?</p>\n","title":"Star Chamber: Secession of the Union (2022)","chair":"Justin Murdock","codirector":"Madhavi Tiruchelvam and Luca Adeishvili","bglink":""},"unoosa":{"content":"","title":"UNOOSA: Lunar Mining","chair":"Tanim Miah","codirector":"Elaine Huang and Lesley Lo","bglink":""},"who":{"content":"","title":"WHO: Genome Sequencing","chair":"Maya Nelson","codirector":"Simone Raleigh","bglink":""}},"details":{"content":"<p>The Stuyvesant Model UN Team is proud to announce that preparations for StuyMUNC 2022 are well under way! </p>\n<p>StuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesant’s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area.
