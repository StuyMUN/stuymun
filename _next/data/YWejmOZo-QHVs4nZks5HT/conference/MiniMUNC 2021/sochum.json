{"pageProps":{"conference":"MiniMUNC 2021","committee":{"content":"<p>What is the cost of morality? Should governments be able to suppress citizens to maintain ethnic tranquility? In the SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict committee, delegates will discuss the ability of governments to defy human rights for the prevention of wars and genocide. Rising ethnic tensions and conflict in places such as Africa and Spain have led to the discussion of if human rights should be protected at all costs. Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid? International law, alliances, and tension all come into play as delegates take up the role of a nation with a specific viewpoint on morality in the face of government action.</p>\n","title":"SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict","chair":"Naya Mukul","codirector":"Cameron Kluger","bglink":"","ordering":2}},"__N_SSG":true}
