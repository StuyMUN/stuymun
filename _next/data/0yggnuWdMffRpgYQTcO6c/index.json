Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.\nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C.
