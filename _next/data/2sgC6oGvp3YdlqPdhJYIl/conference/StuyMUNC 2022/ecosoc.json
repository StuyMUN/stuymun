{"pageProps":{"conference":"StuyMUNC 2022","committee":{"content":"<p>From Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia, South America to the Pacific Islands, brain drain is an increasingly prevalent issue. Brain drain, otherwise known as human capital flight, is when highly skilled and educated individuals immigrate to new countries in hopes of a more fruitful life. The issue with this stems from the fact that emigration from these home countries leaves them with less workers to fulfill the jobs most important to developing nations. This issue is getting progressively desperate as time passes, which, combined with the rise in technology and a decreased reliance on skilled workers, is soon to escalate into something that needs to be addressed by the worldâ€™s top officials. Will delegates be able to create a comprehensive solution to help countries suffering from brain drain? Get ready to step into the shoes of presidents and prime ministers to put a stop to this problem before it&#39;s too late!</p>\n","title":"ECOSOC: Grappling the Economic Affairs of Brain Drain","chair":"Danielle Que","codirector":"Shreya Das","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/2021/stuy/ecosoc.pdf","ordering":3}},"__N_SSG":true}
