Following the Battle of Hastings and the siege of London, William is the first Norman king of England and the nobles must contend with what that means for their future. Small rebellions of peasants and nobles alike stir up trouble and threaten to topple William from his precarious position. It is up to the delegates to decide if they will join the rebellious forces trying to overthrow the new Norman king or attempt to solidify his rule as the new king of England.

From SoHo to Midtown, storefronts are closed and covered. Any store still open has a “Store Closing” sign in its doorway, hoping to attract the rare customer who might pass by. It has been nearly 30 years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city has yet to recover from the financial issues of the time. Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble. Add in the refusal of politicians to work collaboratively across party lines, and you have a complete fiscal fiasco. Enough is enough, and the government has called for a meeting between both city and state leaders to save NYC before it collapses for good.

Should governments be able to suppress citizens to maintain ethnic tranquility? In the SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict committee, delegates will discuss the ability of governments to defy human rights for the prevention of wars and genocide. Rising ethnic tensions and conflict in places such as Africa and Spain have led to the discussion of if human rights should be protected at all costs. Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid? International law, alliances, and tension all come into play as delegates take up the role of a nation with a specific viewpoint on morality in the face of government action.</p>\n","title":"SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict","chair":"Naya Mukul","codirector":"Cameron Kluger","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/sochum.pdf","ordering":2},"theblip":{"content":"<p>Half the world has disappeared after Thanos snapped his fingers in what would later be labelled as “The Blip.” Among those who were lost to this catastrophic event were several of the world’s heroes including the Scarlet Witch, the Winter Soldier, Spider-Man, and the Black Panther. Those who remained were left to care for a world which was suffering massive consequences, along with the arrival of the mysterious Silver Surfer. The Avengers have split up, devastated by their loss to Thanos, and there is no one left to defend against the incoming threat. With the world in shambles, you must come together, formulate a plan and put together a new team to battle the world’s new villain. Will you, as heroes, be able to put your own goals aside and help save the world?
