Brain drain, otherwise known as human capital flight, is when highly skilled and educated individuals immigrate to new countries in hopes of a more fruitful life. The issue with this stems from the fact that emigration from these home countries leaves them with less workers to fulfill the jobs most important to developing nations. This issue is getting progressively desperate as time passes, which, combined with the rise in technology and a decreased reliance on skilled workers, is soon to escalate into something that needs to be addressed by the world’s top officials. Will delegates be able to create a comprehensive solution to help countries suffering from brain drain? Get ready to step into the shoes of presidents and prime ministers to put a stop to this problem before it&#39;s too late!</p>\n","title":"ECOSOC: Grappling the Economic Affairs of Brain Drain","chair":"Danielle Que","codirector":"Shreya Das","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/ecosoc.pdf","ordering":3},"gossipgirl":{"content":"<p>Spotted: Some of Constance Billard-St. Jude’s best and brightest students learning that nothing stays hidden for long.\nGossip Girl is back, and she’s out for blood.

New York City, the biggest port on the entire East Coast, is home to nearly all sorts of activities you can think of. Scheming, drug trafficking, and gambling are just a few of the many ways to make money real quick real fast. Organized crime is on the rise, and it’s made up of all sorts of ethnic groups. Italian, Irish, but most importantly, Jewish gangs are on the rise. In this committee, delegates will represent different Jewish gangsters of the era as they vie for control of the Big Apple and cause conflict, concern, and confusion along the way.</p>\n","title":"Jewish Gangsters","chair":"Sophia Yuditsky","codirector":"Lina Khamze and Andrey Sokolov","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/jewish_gangsters.pdf","ordering":8},"nullification":{"content":"<p>In 1828, a tariff was introduced by President John Quincy Adams to protect the manufacturing of American goods and weaken the colonial relationship that America had with Europe. However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.\nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.\nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights? How will senators adjust to the crisis at hand before it escalates to a Civil War?</p>\n","title":"Historical Committee: US Senate 1832 Nullification Crisis","chair":"Aaron Hui","codirector":"Andrew Park","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/nullification_crisis.pdf","ordering":5},"nycmayoralcabinet":{"content":"<p>In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression. Especially with the onset of COVID-19, it’s been even more apparent how the rich have been getting richer at the expense of the poor getting poorer. Research shows that the primary cause of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing. Surveys of homeless families have identified eviction, severely overcrowded housing, and hazardous housing conditions as some of the major immediate causes of homelessness. Gentrification has always made the accessibility of affordable housing worse––however, it’s only gotten worse. The signs of those who’ve had a more privileged lockdown are palpable: the outdoor cafes sprinkled around the Village are a stark contrast to the 1/3rd of the 700 workers surveyed from Astoria who were laid off. The power of local and regional governments has never been greater, and it’s up to the mayoral candidate to discuss how to effectively ensure affordable housing to ward off the risk of homelessness associated with urban displacement.</p>\n","title":"NYC Mayoral Cabinet: Tackling Gentrification and Homelessness","chair":"Naya Mukul and Olivia Tedesco","codirector":null,"bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/nyc_mayoral.pdf","ordering":6},"starchamber":{"content":"<p>Contrary to its name, the United Kingdom is falling apart! The gaping divide between the various culturally and linguistically distinct nations of the union has widened in recent years, especially following the political and economic turmoil caused by Brexit.  However, the pandemic appears to have pushed these conflicts to their breaking point, culminating in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland formally calling for secession. This committee deals with these complex issues of unification, calling on an assortment of representatives from across the British Isles to discuss what it means to be part of a union. To make things even more interesting, delegates are discussing these issues in the form of the secretive medieval court known as the “Star Chamber”, allowing for unlikely alliances and solutions. The delegates have the power to decide, once and for all: will this Union stand or be no more—and will it be by peace or by war?</p>\n","title":"Star Chamber: Secession of the Union (2022)","chair":"Justin Murdock","codirector":"Madhavi Tiruchelvam and Luca Adeishvili","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/star_chamber.pdf","ordering":7},"unoosa":{"content":"<p>As humans deplete earth’s finite resources, more attention has been given to a potential solution. Scientific findings suggest that the moon may contain vast resources such as water and rare minerals that are scarce on earth. Many countries have taken an interest in the prospect of lunar mining to extract these valuable resources for purposes such as producing energy and advancing technology. However, ethical consequences and environmental damage are only a few of the unknowns that come with lunar mining. There is also the question of whether or not nations or private companies can claim ownership of the moon. In this committee, delegates will discuss potential benefits and possible drawbacks of mining on the moon, and seek to establish a UN convention overseeing nations’ rights to moon resources and extraction. Let the lunar gold rush begin!</p>\n","title":"UNOOSA: Lunar Mining","chair":"Tanim Miah","codirector":"Elaine Huang and Lesley Lo","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/unoosa.pdf","ordering":2},"who":{"content":"<p>In this committee, we will be focusing on the controversy surrounding genome editing, a form of genetic engineering in which DNA is altered, removed, replaced, or added inside the genome of a living organism. There is a strong opposition to this with critics arguing that CRISPR and related methods are not fully safe to use, and the idea of creating a more “desirable” gene pool through artificially altering the human genome can give rise to eugenics. In addition, many countries already have laws and restrictions in place that limit gene editing, while some have gone so far as to completely ban the practice. With this topic generating much controversy, delegates will discuss the pros and cons of gene editing for the unborn and the potential implications this can have on society, and whether this is a goal worth pursuing and if so, how it can be implemented.</p>\n","title":"WHO: Genome Sequencing","chair":"Maya Nelson","codirector":"Simone Raleigh","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/Guides/who.pdf","ordering":1}},"details":{"content":"<p>The Stuyvesant Model UN Team is proud to announce that preparations for StuyMUNC 2022 are well under way! </p>\n<p>StuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesant’s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area.
