However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.\nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.\nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights?

Especially with the onset of COVID-19, it’s been even more apparent how the rich have been getting richer at the expense of the poor getting poorer.

Surveys of homeless families have identified eviction, severely overcrowded housing, and hazardous housing conditions as some of the major immediate causes of homelessness. Gentrification has always made the accessibility of affordable housing worse––however, it’s only gotten worse. The signs of those who’ve had a more privileged lockdown are palpable: the outdoor cafes sprinkled around the Village are a stark contrast to the 1/3rd of the 700 workers surveyed from Astoria who were laid off.
