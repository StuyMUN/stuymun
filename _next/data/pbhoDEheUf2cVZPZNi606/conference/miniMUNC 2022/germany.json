As the East German economy collapses and conditions in Soviet-controlled territory continue to worsen much of the West is pushing to reunite the country. Reunifying a nation that was divided between conflicting global superpowers is no easy task, the social, political, and economic divides are visible in every aspect of life on both sides. Together the delegates of this committee will have the complex task of stitching Germany back together and ensuring its prosperous future as it becomes a whole and independent nation once more. The future of German lives is in your hands now, delegates.
