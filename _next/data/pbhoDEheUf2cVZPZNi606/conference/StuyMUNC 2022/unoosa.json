{"pageProps":{"conference":"StuyMUNC 2022","committee":{"content":"<p>As humans deplete earth’s finite resources, more attention has been given to a potential solution. Scientific findings suggest that the moon may contain vast resources such as water and rare minerals that are scarce on earth. Many countries have taken an interest in the prospect of lunar mining to extract these valuable resources for purposes such as producing energy and advancing technology. However, ethical consequences and environmental damage are only a few of the unknowns that come with lunar mining. There is also the question of whether or not nations or private companies can claim ownership of the moon. In this committee, delegates will discuss potential benefits and possible drawbacks of mining on the moon, and seek to establish a UN convention overseeing nations’ rights to moon resources and extraction. Let the lunar gold rush begin!</p>\n","title":"UNOOSA: Lunar Mining","chair":"Tanim Miah","codirector":"Elaine Huang and Lesley Lo","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/2021/stuy/unoosa.pdf","ordering":2}},"__N_SSG":true}
