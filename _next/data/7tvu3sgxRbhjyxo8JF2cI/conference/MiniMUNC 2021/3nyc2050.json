{"pageProps":{"conference":"MiniMUNC 2021","committee":{"content":"<p>The city’s richest residents have moved to the Midwest. From SoHo to Midtown, storefronts are closed and covered. Any store still open has a “Store Closing” sign in its doorway, hoping to attract the rare customer who might pass by. The city that once had a population of nearly 8.5 million now has a population of 5 million, as many residents fled to places that offered more stability. It has been nearly 30 years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city has yet to recover from the financial issues of the time. Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble. Add in the refusal of politicians to work collaboratively across party lines, and you have a complete fiscal fiasco. Enough is enough, and the government has called for a meeting between both city and state leaders to save NYC before it collapses for good. Your decisions will determine the future of the Big Apple so be ready to debate, negotiate, and collaborate in this futuristic committee!</p>\n","title":"NYC 2050 Fiscal Crisis","chair":"Maya Dunayer","codirector":"Danielle Que","bglink":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
