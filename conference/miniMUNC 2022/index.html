This conference is designed as a practice conference for <strong>novices</strong> and will give you a glimpse into politics, history, and solving problems on the fly. The committees were designed to be engaging, with novices being able to gain practice in public speaking, collaboration, and attention to details. There is absolutely no experience or knowledge required, and we would greatly appreciate you signing up!</p>

The goal of capital punishment is to execute criminals convicted of intentional killing to prevent them from murdering again, thereby maintaining the safety of citizens. However, the death penalty is not only used against murderers; others have been executed for crimes such as drug crimes. Having the death penalty always runs the risk of executing innocent people, especially in cases in which people are convicted largely due to their race or ethnicity, rather than substantial evidence. In OHCHR: Validity of the Death Penalty, delegates will discuss the merits of the death penalty and debate its use.</p>

However, with the growing effect of climate change, and the continued problem of world hunger, sustainability and reduction of waste is more important than ever. Delegates will be thrown into what is possibly the biggest crisis that humanity faces: accelerated by the dual catastrophes of the COVID pandemic and war in Ukraine, delegates will have to identify, then propose solutions to sources of waste throughout the world. Delegates will also have to consider the perspectives of a diverse variety of countries, each with their own interests.</p>

As the sport’s voices, they have taken it upon themselves to discuss the future of F1. Classic race tracks with iconic histories are being replaced with new street circuits in wealthy countries. The climate crisis has brought questions about the sustainability of gas-powered racing. Conversations about race and money have been brought to the forefront by the lack of diversity and large costs &amp; spending across the league. The drivers each have an agenda and issues most important to them, but they must reach a consensus before qualifying begins.</p>

As the East German economy collapses and conditions in Soviet-controlled territory continue to worsen much of the West is pushing to reunite the country. Reunifying a nation that was divided between conflicting global superpowers is no easy task, the social, political, and economic divides are visible in every aspect of life on both sides. Together the delegates of this committee will have the complex task of stitching Germany back together and ensuring its prosperous future as it becomes a whole and independent nation once more. The future of German lives is in your hands now, delegates. Tread carefully, may your hearts guide you with kindness and your heads with reason to a reunified Germany!</p>

Following the great warrior’s sudden death, his expansive empire is left incredibly unstable, with no clear future. Emperor Alexander left no direct heirs or able male relatives to take the throne, so the government is thrown into chaos.  The local aristocracy begins battling and negotiating for control over the wealthiest and largest fragments of this great empire. Meanwhile, they struggle to protect the unstable nation they hope to control from peasant uprisings and invasions from other civilizations who seek to take advantage of the chaos. The power to divide this massive and very wealthy empire is now in your hands. As a delegate, it’s up to you to decide how to maintain, or destroy, the grand and expansive empire Alexander built. Will you seize your opportunity to build a successful civilization or will you fall victim to your fellow nobles&#39; attempts to destroy it? The choice is yours.</p>
</div></div></div><div><div class="committee-preview"><h3><a href="/conference/miniMUNC%202022/frostpunk/">Frostpunk</a></h3><div class="__markdown"><p>In the Summer of 1886, strange weather patterns started to appear across the world. Killer snow storms in northern areas, frost in tropical areas—the situation continued to worsen until these weather conditions caused the Great Frost. This phenomena soon made the world inhospitable without the aid of Heat Generator Towers. Civilization collapsed, but with the help of Britain’s Generators built in the northern reaches of the globe, it was shown that the preservation of life in these harsh conditions is possible. The newest (and perhaps one of the last) settlements in this barren world, New London, faces potentially catastrophic threats from the harsh weather and wilderness, a lack of stable government, and increasingly scarce resources. It is up to you, great scientists, explorers, and politicians of today, to create and develop your new home in the settlement of New London while facing these threats. Are you ready to brave the storm and ensure New London&#39;s future?</p>
