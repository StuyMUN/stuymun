Northern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C.

With President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights? How will senators adjust to the crisis at hand before it escalates to a Civil War?</p>
