<p>StuyMUNC first began as a training conference for members of Stuyvesant’s Model UN team, but has since expanded to an invitational conference for high schools from the tri-state area. StuyMUNC has grown tremendously over the last two decades; last year alone, we hosted over 200 participants in eleven committees, topics of which ranged from Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic to being a pirate during the Golden Age of Piracy. </p>
<p>We are proud to invite you to our 18th annual conference and hope that you will join us this May as we begin yet another exciting conference.</p>

Northern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Senator John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.
