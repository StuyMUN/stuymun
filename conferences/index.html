Following the great warrior’s sudden death, his expansive empire is left incredibly unstable, with no clear future. Emperor Alexander left no direct heirs or able male relatives to take the throne, so the government is thrown into chaos.  The local aristocracy begins battling and negotiating for control over the wealthiest and largest fragments of this great empire. Meanwhile, they struggle to protect the unstable nation they hope to control from peasant uprisings and invasions from other civilizations who seek to take advantage of the chaos. The power to divide this massive and very wealthy empire is now in your hands. As a delegate, it’s up to you to decide how to maintain, or destroy, the grand and expansive empire Alexander built.

The climate crisis has brought questions about the sustainability of gas-powered racing. Conversations about race and money have been brought to the forefront by the lack of diversity and large costs \u0026amp; spending across the league.

This phenomena soon made the world inhospitable without the aid of Heat Generator Towers. Civilization collapsed, but with the help of Britain’s Generators built in the northern reaches of the globe, it was shown that the preservation of life in these harsh conditions is possible. The newest (and perhaps one of the last) settlements in this barren world, New London, faces potentially catastrophic threats from the harsh weather and wilderness, a lack of stable government, and increasingly scarce resources. It is up to you, great scientists, explorers, and politicians of today, to create and develop your new home in the settlement of New London while facing these threats.

Together the delegates of this committee will have the complex task of stitching Germany back together and ensuring its prosperous future as it becomes a whole and independent nation once more.

The goal of capital punishment is to execute criminals convicted of intentional killing to prevent them from murdering again, thereby maintaining the safety of citizens. However, the death penalty is not only used against murderers; others have been executed for crimes such as drug crimes. Having the death penalty always runs the risk of executing innocent people, especially in cases in which people are convicted largely due to their race or ethnicity, rather than substantial evidence.

Brain drain, otherwise known as human capital flight, is when highly skilled and educated individuals immigrate to new countries in hopes of a more fruitful life. The issue with this stems from the fact that emigration from these home countries leaves them with less workers to fulfill the jobs most important to developing nations. This issue is getting progressively desperate as time passes, which, combined with the rise in technology and a decreased reliance on skilled workers, is soon to escalate into something that needs to be addressed by the world’s top officials.

However, the tariff rates were 49% - an all-time high. It was aptly named the Tariff of Abomination. Opinions on the tariff were heavily divided, especially by geographical region.\nNorthern manufacturers who had to compete with European imported goods were benefited by the tariff, but Southern plantation farmers, who were largely reliant on European trade to finance their farming, were not. Southerners such as Vice President John C. Calhoun became a strong proponent of nullification, or the right for states to decide the constitutionality of protective tariffs and reject federal laws in their own borders, whereas Northerners, such as Senator Daniel Webster, believed federal courts were appropriate for deciding the constitutionality of legislation.\nWith President Andrew Jackson in power after his election in 1828, the divided Senate must sway him towards one side. Will he stand with his anti-nullification views that allowed for his greater centralized power, or will he fall back on his southern loyalties and values based on states’ rights?

Especially with the onset of COVID-19, it’s been even more apparent how the rich have been getting richer at the expense of the poor getting poorer. Research shows that the primary cause of homelessness is the lack of affordable housing. Surveys of homeless families have identified eviction, severely overcrowded housing, and hazardous housing conditions as some of the major immediate causes of homelessness. Gentrification has always made the accessibility of affordable housing worse––however, it’s only gotten worse. The signs of those who’ve had a more privileged lockdown are palpable: the outdoor cafes sprinkled around the Village are a stark contrast to the 1/3rd of the 700 workers surveyed from Astoria who were laid off.

This committee deals with these complex issues of unification, calling on an assortment of representatives from across the British Isles to discuss what it means to be part of a union. To make things even more interesting, delegates are discussing these issues in the form of the secretive medieval court known as the “Star Chamber”, allowing for unlikely alliances and solutions.

However, ethical consequences and environmental damage are only a few of the unknowns that come with lunar mining. There is also the question of whether or not nations or private companies can claim ownership of the moon.

In addition, many countries already have laws and restrictions in place that limit gene editing, while some have gone so far as to completely ban the practice.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that about 14% of jobs today are vulnerable to automation. Job decline has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with unemployment rates increasing and employers making an effort to avoid human contact. However, automation can also be seen in a positive light, as it boosts productivity and allows new professions to be created. Delegates will have the opportunity to decide whether automation is beneficial or not, how to make automation equitable for workers and help them adapt to a changing work environment, and how market and consumer demands can be met at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","title":"ECOSOC: Right of Work","chair":"Neve Diaz Carr","codirector":"Aaron Hui","bglink":"https://www.stuymun.org/docs/2021/mini/ecosoc.pdf","ordering":1},"england":{"content":"\u003cp\u003eEngland is in shambles following the landmark coup d’etat staged by William the Conqueror and it\u0026#39;s up to the court of nobles to rebuild.

Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble.

Rising ethnic tensions and conflict in places such as Africa and Spain have led to the discussion of if human rights should be protected at all costs. Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid?
