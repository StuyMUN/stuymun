Should governments be able to suppress citizens to maintain ethnic tranquility? In the SOCHUM: Government Right to Moderate Conflict committee, delegates will discuss the ability of governments to defy human rights for the prevention of wars and genocide. Rising ethnic tensions and conflict in places such as Africa and Spain have led to the discussion of if human rights should be protected at all costs. Some governments are imprisoning, torturing, or even killing citizens to prevent ethnic conflicts. Are their means justifiable? But even so, are their claims of peacekeeping valid?

From SoHo to Midtown, storefronts are closed and covered. Any store still open has a “Store Closing” sign in its doorway, hoping to attract the rare customer who might pass by. The city that once had a population of nearly 8.5 million now has a population of 5 million, as many residents fled to places that offered more stability. It has been nearly 30 years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city has yet to recover from the financial issues of the time. Over time, New York’s financial problems only worsened, reaching a never before seen state of trouble. Add in the refusal of politicians to work collaboratively across party lines, and you have a complete fiscal fiasco.

A ceasefire has been established, despite the past bloodshed and destruction, but the chaos isn’t over yet. Delegates have to deal with the short-term problems of resolving the refugee crisis, preventing ethnic cleansing, and rebuilding the parts of Cyprus that have been destroyed.

Following the Battle of Hastings and the siege of London, William is the first Norman king of England and the nobles must contend with what that means for their future. Small rebellions of peasants and nobles alike stir up trouble and threaten to topple William from his precarious position. It is up to the delegates to decide if they will join the rebellious forces trying to overthrow the new Norman king or attempt to solidify his rule as the new king of England.

Those who remained were left to care for a world which was suffering massive consequences, along with the arrival of the mysterious Silver Surfer. The Avengers have split up, devastated by their loss to Thanos, and there is no one left to defend against the incoming threat. With the world in shambles, you must come together, formulate a plan and put together a new team to battle the world’s new villain.
